# Crowd Dynamics at Fringe Festival 2024

## Project Overview

The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is a massive cultural event, drawing visitors from across the world. However, this influx of people creates congestion at key venues, affecting accessibility and the festival experience for both locals and tourists. Our project explores how foot traffic can be redistributed effectively to enhance accessibility while maintaining festival engagement.

We developed a spatio-temporal model using heatmaps of crowd density at different times of the day. By layering these heatmaps onto transparent surfaces, we created a physical-digital hybrid model that allows users to visualize and interact with festival crowd patterns dynamically.

## Dataset Processing

Used Fringe Society data (2024) to analyze ticket purchases and event locations.
Cleaned and merged datasets, formatted timestamps, and removed duplicates.
‍
## Heatmap Generation

Created heatmaps using Folium to represent crowd density across the city.
Applied HeatMapWithTime to visualize how density evolves throughout the day.

## Results & Insights

✅ Hotspot Trends Identified: We mapped crowd density variations throughout the day.

✅ Popular Fringe Zones Highlighted: The model identified peak congestion areas.

✅ Multi-Sensory Interaction: Users could explore festival crowd patterns through both digital and physical mediums.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is from the Fringe Society 2024 dataset (provided to us by TRAVELTECH FOR SCOTLAND), which contains ticket sales and event location data. Due to its large size, it is not included in this repository.
